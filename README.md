# Spotify-Recommendation-System


 Spotify is the world's largest music streaming service provider, with over 365 million monthly active users, including 165 million paying subscribers, as of June 2021. One way in which Spotify keeps its users not only satisfied with, but also hooked to the platform, is by making smart and personal recommendations to users based on their listening history. Such recommendation systems are used by many more companies to provide a highly personal user experience.

 I will be developing a basic content-based recommendation system for Spotify. Beginning with some exploratory Data Analysis.
 
 Recommender systems are active information filtering systems which personalize the information coming to a user based on their interests, relevance of the information etc. Recommender systems are used widely for recommending movies, articles, restaurants, places to visit, items to buy etc. Recommendation systems "recommend" personalized content on the basis of userâ€™s past/current preference to improve the user experience.
 
 
  To abstract the features of the items in the system, an item presentation algorithm is applied. A widely used algorithm is the vector space representation. Such a content-based recommendation system makes recommendations based on the proximity of an item's vector to the vector of an item that the user likes. Those items whose vector representations are close to the vector representation of an item already liked by the user are recommended.
  
  Using the datasets found in Kaggle, I will work on this project.
